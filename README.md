# Sentimental_Analysis-NLP-

Mini-Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Mobile Phone Ratings

Description: In this mini-project, I conducted sentiment analysis on mobile phone ratings using Python. Leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP), I analyzed user reviews to extract insights regarding the sentiment associated with different mobile phones. The primary Python libraries utilized include pandas for data manipulation, plotly for visualization, textblob for sentiment analysis, and wordcloud for generating visual representations of word frequency.

Key Components:
1.Data Acquisition: Gathered user reviews and corresponding ratings for various mobile phones.
2.Data Preparation: Preprocessed the text data to remove noise, such as punctuation and stopwords.
3.Sentiment Analysis: Utilized textblob, a Python library for processing textual data, to determine the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of each review.
4.Visualization: Employed plotly to create interactive visualizations, allowing for the exploration of sentiment trends across different mobile phones.
5.Word Cloud Generation: Designed word clouds using the wordcloud library to visually represent the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews, aiding in the identification of key themes.

Outcome: This mini-project yielded valuable insights into the sentiment of mobile phone users, providing a nuanced understanding of customer opinions and preferences. The combination of data analysis and visualization techniques facilitated the identification of trends and patterns within the review dataset, contributing to informed decision-making in the mobile phone industry.
